Unfortunately, the original Sliding Window Approach where Tran and Test Data Sets were generated by shuffling data, were prone to overfitting.
That is because if row for Hour X was in the Training Set, a row for Hour X+e, where e is small, was likely to be in the Test Set. 
So in a way, we were validing against training data (since weather changes does not change much within a few hours). BAD!

A better approach is to train on one set of years and test on another. Indeed, results with that are much less impressive. They are found below :(
